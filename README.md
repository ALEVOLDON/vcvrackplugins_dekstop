## Recorder

A recorder module that writes input as 8-channel WAV files. Press the black record button to activate. In contrast to external recording options it deals very well with audio stutter caused by high CPU load.

## GateSEQ8

An 8-channel gate sequencer with up to 12 steps. A clock multiplier parameter allows to run multiple sequencer modules at different speeds. 

## TriSEQ3

A 3-channel, 3-state sequencer with up to 8 steps. A basic modification of the Fundamental SEQ3.
